# Differentiator
A program counting the derivative of one-variable functions and exporting the result to LaTeX. May be quite useful during the calculus course as long as it is able to work with pretty complex functions.
# Supported operations
 - sum (+)
 - substitution (-)
 - multiplication (*)
 - division (/)
 - sine (sin)
 - cosine (cos)
 - natural logarithm (ln)
 - degree (^)
 # Expression format
 The expressions and the variables must be taken into brackets with space left between the symbols, i(.e.
  - ( ( x ) + ( 4 ) );
  - ( cos ( ( x ) ^ ( x ) ) );
  - ( ln ( ( x ) + ( 100 ) ) ).
